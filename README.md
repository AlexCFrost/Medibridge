Overview

MediBridge is a privacy-first AI application that translates complex medical reports into clear, patient-friendly explanations. It is designed to reduce anxiety, improve medical literacy, and help patients prepare meaningful questions for their next doctor appointment—without providing diagnoses or medical advice.
